## iqontrol adapter for ioBroker

Fast Web-App for Visualization.

![Example](img/screenshot1.jpg)
![Example](img/screenshot2.jpg)

Runs in any Browser.
You can save it as Web-App on iOS-Homescreen and it looks and feels like a nativ app.
ItÂ´s fully customizable.

## Knowns issues
This is the first alpha-Release, so there may be a lot of bugs. But for me it runs completely stable.
However there are a few limitations:
- Uploading images (as background-images or for skinning device-buttons) works, but renaming and deleting does not work
- Creating and deleting sub-directories is also not working.
You can do these operations manually via ftp under iobroker/iobroker-data/files/iqontrol/userimages

Please feel free to comment and let me know, how to fix these issues!
