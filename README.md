## iqontrol adapter for ioBroker

Fast Web-App for Visualization.

![Example](img/screenshot1.jpg)
![Example](img/screenshot2.jpg)

Runs in any Browser.
You can save it as Web-App on iOS-Homescreen and it looks and feels like a nativ app.
ItÂ´s fully customizable.

## You need...
* Nodejs 8 or higher
* socketIO has to be enabled in web-adapter

## How to use
* Start creating views.
	You can consider views as something like a pages.
* Then create devices on these views.
	Devices have a role, that detemines the function of the device, which icons are used and so on.
	Depending on that role you can link several states to the device. These will give the device its functionality.
	If you select 'Link to other view' as role you can create links to other views. I suggest skinning Links to other views with the same Background, the linked view has.
	You can also try to use the Autocreate-Function to chose an existing device from the iobroker-object-tree. Autocreate tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
* Afterwards you can create a toolbar, wich is displayed as footer.
	Toolbar-Entrys are links to views.
	The first Toolbar-Entry will be your 'Home-View' with will be loaded at start.
* To give everything a fancy style, you can upload your own images.
	You can use your images as background-images for views, or for devices.
	The free builtin demo-wallpapers are from www.pexels.com.

## Knowns issues
This is the first alpha-Release, so there may be a lot of bugs. But for me it runs completely stable.
However there are a few limitations:
- Uploading images (as background-images or for skinning device-buttons) works, but renaming and deleting does not work
- Creating and deleting sub-directories is also not working.
You can do these operations manually via ftp under iobroker/iobroker-data/files/iqontrol/userimages

Please feel free to comment and let me know, how to fix these issues!

## Description of roles and associated states
Every device has a role, wich defines the function of the device. Every role generates a set of states, wich can be linked to a corresponding io-broker state.
If you use the auto-create-function, you can chose an existing device from the io-broker-object tree.  Autocreate tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
This will only work for known devices. For unknown devices, and to give devices advanced features, you can add devices manually or edit the devices that were created by autocreate.
To edit the role and the linked states of a device, click on the pencil behind the device. You will find a short description of the roles and the used states below:

### General states:
Every role has the following three states:
* BATTERY: boolean - when true, a little battery-empty-icon will be displayed
* ERROR: boolean - when true, a little exclamation-mark-icon will be displayed
* UNREACH: boolean - when true, a little wireless-icon will be displayed

Most of the roles have a STATE-state. Mostly it represents the main function of the device. You can assign io-broker-states of the following types to it:
* boolean - if possible, it will be translated to a senseful text like 'on/off', 'opened/closed' or similar. If you click on the icon of a tile it trys to toggle the boolean (for example to turn a light on or off). If it is not read-only it will generate a flip-switch in the dialog.
* number - will be displayed with its corresponding unit and generate a slider in the dialog.
* string - a text to be displayed
* value-list - the selected value will be displayed. If it is not write-protected it will generate a drop-down-menu in dialog. Technically an value-list is a number with a corresponding translation-list, defined in the 'native.states' property.

However, not every type makes sense to every role. So the STATE of a switch for example will be a boolean in most cases, to be able to be toggled between on and off. A string may be displayed, but the switch will not be functional.

### Links to other view:
* Has no further states, but it will respect the linked-view-property

### <img src="img/icons/switch_on.png" width="32"> Switch, <img src="img/icons/fan_on.png" width="32"> Fan:
